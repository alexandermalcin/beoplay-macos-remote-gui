# BeoplayRemoteGUI.app

This is an unofficial menu bar app for Mac OS to remote control network enabled beoplay loudspeakers such as the Beoplay M5.

## Example

The menu bar has basic support for play/pause, forward/backward (fx for shuffling between favourite radio stations). The volume level can be adjusted and works well with volume adjustments made directly on the loudspeakers, through the original Bang&Olufsen iOS app, Spotify, etc. Speakers are automatically discovered via Bonjour.

## Building
Open BeoplayRemoteGUI.xcodeproj and build the project with XCode.
